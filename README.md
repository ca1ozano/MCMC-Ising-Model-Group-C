# MCMC-Ising-Model-Group-C

The montecarlo.cpp file is the code that is used to generate the heatmap data. For the .gif files, the magnetizationevo.ipynb file can be used, while the hysteresis.ipynb file is used to create the hysteresis graph. Both notebooks are standalone and do not require any other files to run.
